# Public Service Calendar (ON/QC)

A calendar of pay days and holidays for federal employees.

## Preview online

Preview the calendar [here](https://www.outlook.com/calendar/published/0111402c-962c-4704-8ed0-e4ae8de42b9e/cc5763bf-9777-48f9-9ab7-edb20b932231/cid-F168D51DED2D70DD/calendar.html). This preview only shows events that occur in the next six months.

## Add to your calendar

When you subscribe to a calendar (preferred), changes and future additions are synchronized to your calendar automatically. When you import a calendar, only a static 'snapshot' of events is added to your calendar. Learn more [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-outlook-com-or-outlook-on-the-web-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you import the .ics file rather than subscribing, the calendar will not refresh (i.e., for corrections, or the addition of next year's events). Return here next year, and re-import the calendar.
